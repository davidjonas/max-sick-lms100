General Idea
============

+ Get the latest and greates pySick (BlobServer)
+ Find it working with SickViz3
- Start SickExternal patch that can talk to SickViz3
  (using the same OSC messages internally)
- Get SickExternal to produce the same results as parts of BlobServer

Architecture
============

 * [tcpclient host port]
   * creates a tcp socket to given host:port, allows sending things to and
     receiving things from
   * can send messages in ascii, with configurable line prefix/postfix
   * can receive messages in ascii, -->>--

   Ref:
   * socket(), setsockopt(), getsockopt()
   * fcntl() to set to non-blocking
   * Max clock or qelem to schedule the polling
   * sending: use qelem or defer to schedule sending in low-prio thread
   * http://cs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/practical/CSockets/textcode.html
   * http://artm.pastebay.com/26902

   * Consider alternatives
     * Norm Jaffe's tcp objects for max4.6
       * they don't work in Max5 but try to emulate as close as possible
     * jit.net.* - can't use, they enforce protocol.

 * [sick.lms1xx]
   * creates tcpclient internally
   * sets it up with messages
   * implements sane message protocol
   * converts scanned data to jitter matrices

NOW
===

[ ] jitter SDK documentation

LATER
=====

[ ] assists
[ ] asserts, warnings etc

FAR FUTURE
==========

[ ] check sanity of the format conversion values
